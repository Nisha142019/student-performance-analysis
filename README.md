# Student Performance Analysis

This project looks at student exam performance and explores how different factors like gender, parental education, and test preparation affect their scores.  
It’s a small data analysis project I built while learning Python and data science.

---

##  What I Did
- Cleaned and explored the dataset using "Pandas"
- Created visualizations with "Matplotlib"
- Compared performance trends between groups
- Used a simple regression model to predict math scores
- Generated some plots and insights from the data

---

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

---

##  Example Outputs
- Gender-based performance comparison  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Predicted vs actual math scores

##  About This Project
I created this as part of my learning journey in *machine learning and data analysis* during my BSc (Hons) Computer Science degree.  
It helped me understand the basics of data cleaning, visualization, and simple predictive modeling.
